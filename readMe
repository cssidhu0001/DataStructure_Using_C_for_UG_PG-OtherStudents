DataStructure_Using_C_for_UG_PG-OtherStudents
Welcome to your comprehensive repository designed to help undergraduate and postgraduate students master data structures using the C programming language! This project aims to provide clear, practical C programs for essential data structures and algorithms, making it easy for students to find solutions and contribute new programs. Whether you are preparing for exams, interviews, or strengthening your coding fundamentals, this repo serves as your go-to resource.

🚀 Features
1. Programs covering all major data structures using C
2. Well-documented code for easy understanding
3. Open for student contributions (pull requests are welcome!)
4. Support for queries and requests via comments or direct contact
5. Continually updated with new topics and programs

🔥 Table of Contents
Below are the data structures and algorithms commonly covered in such a repository. Please customize this list by editing it once your repo’s file list is refreshed (since the current file reading failed):

Arrays
Basic array operations (traversal, insertion, deletion)

Searching (Linear Search, Binary Search)

Sorting (Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, Quick Sort, Merge Sort)

Matrix operations (addition, multiplication, transpose)

Linked Lists
Singly Linked List (creation, insertion, deletion, searching, traversal)

Doubly Linked List (creation, insertion, deletion, traversal)

Circular Linked List

Operations like reversal, concatenation

Stacks
Stack implementation (array and linked list)

Push, pop, peek operations

Applications (infix to postfix conversion, expression evaluation)

Queues
Queue implementation (array and linked list)

Circular queue

Double-ended queue (deque)

Priority queue

Trees
Binary Tree (creation, insertion, traversal: inorder, preorder, postorder)

Tree traversals (DFS, BFS)

AVL Trees and other variants

Graphs
Representation (adjacency matrix, adjacency list)

BFS and DFS traversal

Shortest path algorithms

Others
Hash Tables

Recursion examples (factorial, Fibonacci, Tower of Hanoi, GCD, etc.)

Practice problems and solutions
